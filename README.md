# RankedRetrieval

This was a project I did as part of my Big Data and Information Retrieval Course.
The various LevelDB directories store data from a crawl of Wikipedia, at varying sizes.
The basic idea of the assignment is to implement 1997 Google-style page rank based on [tf-idf ranking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf).

This project is a little messy and was never meant to be turned in (our performance was assessed by getting the "correct" rankings
when asked for a search term on a Canvas quiz).

All the pre-formed LevelDB databases should be already present and the project should be able to run, after editing some of the file paths.
